# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Disease Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a disease based on user-provided medical inputs. The interface is built using Streamlit, where users enter different health parameters, and the model analyzes these values to generate a prediction result.

It provides a clean form layout, processes the input through a trained ML model, and displays whether the user is likely to have the disease or not.

Run Locally

After downloading the project, replace the file path with your own and run:

streamlit run "c:\Users\avach\Downloads\tech saksham disease prediction\disease_prediction.py"


This will launch the application on your local browser (localhost).
